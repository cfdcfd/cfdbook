It is important to distinguish between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
In both cases, samples x are assumed to be obtained by selecting a state of nature
!i with probability P(!i), and then independently selecting x according to the probability
law p(xj!i). The distinction is that with supervised learning we know the state
of nature (class label) for each sample, whereas with unsupervised learning we do not.
As one would expect, the problem of unsupervised learning is the more di±cult one.
In this chapter we shall consider only the supervised case, deferring consideration of
unsupervised learning to Chap. ??.

区分有监督学习和无监督学习:

两者基于相同的假设
样本x可以被一系列的分类标签$w_i$定义,
每个分类标签的概率为$P(w_i)$,
样本x的值由概率密度$p(x|w_i)$决定
